CS340 Database Project
Authors: Theresa Quach and Lianghui Wang

Project Library is a simplified library database management system that is intended to be used primarily by the administrators of a metropolitan public library to track the books, authors, 
and publishers found within the library system, as well as the library's registered patrons and their borrowing records. As such, every page on this site (Authors, Publishers, Books, Borrowers, and Borrowing Record Items) 
contains functionality that will allow administrators to View, Add, Update (except for Borrowing Record Items), and Delete entries.

The Project consists of a webpage UI built using HTML/CSS and Node.js pulling information from a MySQL database
