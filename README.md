CS340 Database Project
Authors: Theresa Quach and Lianghui Wang

Project Library is a simplified library database management system that is intended to be used primarily by the administrators of a small public library to track the books, authors, 
and publishers found within the library system, as well as the library's registered patrons and their borrowing records. As such, every page on this site (Authors, Publishers, Books, Borrowers, and Borrowing Record Items) contains functionality that will allow administrators to View, Add, Update, and Delete entries.

The Project consists of a webpage UI built using HTML/CSS and Node.js with CRUD capabilities that allow the library administrative user to
alter the information found on a MYSQL Database also created by our group to organize the data for the library.

All code to construct the database DDL.sql file, handlebar templates, and primary application file app.js has been based on and adapted from code found in the CS340 modules and the starter Node.js git guide, with the exception of the CSS file we created for the styling of our webpage.
